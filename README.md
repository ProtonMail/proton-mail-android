## Setup

The most straightforward way to build and run this application is to:

- Install Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/install
- Clone the repository. You have two options:
	- Use the `Project from version control` in Android Studio, or
	- Use the `git clone` command and import it into Android Studio
- Build and run the app directly in Android Studio

Alternatively, if you want to build the app directly from the command line (or using a different IDE, etc.), you will first need to install the command line tools from: https://developer.android.com/studio#cmdline-tools. Then you will need to install the SDK using the `sdkmanager` tool. After cloning the repository with `git clone` you will need to edit the `local.properties` file so that it points to the location of the SDK. Depending on which operating systems you use, the location of the SDK is usually:

- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk`
- MacOS: `/Users/<username>/Library/Android/Sdk/`
- Linux: `/home/<username>/Android/Sdk/`

Then, go to the appâ€™s root directory in the command line tool and run:

- `./gradlew assembleBetaDebug`
- `adb install ./app/build/outputs/apk/beta/debug/ProtonMail-Android-1.XX.X-beta-debug.apk`

### Note: In app notifications when building from source
**When building from source, in app push notifications for new emails will not work out of the box.**

The app uses Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service to deliver push notifications. However, we are not publishing the production version of the configuration files needed to set up this service, because the values specified within are deemed sensitive.
Instead, we publish dummy versions of the files (`config/google-services/dummy-google-services.json` and `config/google-services/dummy-google-services-beta.json`) which allows you to build the app without push notifications. The dummy files will be copied to the relevant folders once you run the ./gradlew command.

We may offer alternative push notification systems in the future which do not rely on Google services.

## Contributions

Contributions are appreciated, but must conform to Proton Guidelines.

#### Branch naming

Branch names must respect the pattern `type/description-of-the-change`.

*Type* must be one of the following:

* `chore` for changes not related to the Kotlin source code, for example a change in the build config
* `doc` for changes related to source code documentation, or external document, like the README
* `feat` for a new feature for the app
* `fix` for bug fixes
* `refactor` for improving one or more unit of code, without impacting the behaviour of the app
* `test` for everything related to test ( add a new test suite, add a new test into an already existing test suite or improve/modify the performance or the behaviour of an already existing test )

_description of change_ must be a concise and meaningful description of what is expected by the change apported; words must be separated by a dash `-`

The whole name of the branch must be lower case.

#### Commit message

The template for a commit message is the following

```
<Title of the commit>

#comment <Description of the changes>
Affected: <List of affected classes or behaviours>
```

_Title_ is required and must start with a capital letter.

`#comment` field is optional if the Title can exhaustively explain the changes, otherwise is required. Body of the comment must start with a capital letter.

`Affected` is optional and must be a comma separated list of the elements affected by the changes, it could be the name of a class or a behaviour like `Encryption, Login flow, LoginActivity.kt`

#### Code style and pattern

The code must conform the standards defined in the files `config/CodeStyle.xml` and `config/detekt.xml`.

`CodeStyle.xml` can be imported in the IDE ( _Preferences -> Editor -> Code Style -> Import scheme_ for IntelliJ and Android Studio ).

Detekt reports can be generated with the command `./gradlew detekt`. Check _Detekt GitHub_ documentation for know how to download and configure the **optional** IDE plugin.
